Welcome to my journey through the **AWS DevOps Challenge**! This repository documents all projects and learning activities as I progress through the challenge, building and improving my DevOps skills.

## Overview
The **AWS DevOps Challenge** is a structured learning path designed to help participants master core DevOps concepts, tools, and practices. The projects span a variety of DevOps domains, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, containerization, and monitoring.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by days, with each day's project in its own folder:

```
.
├── 1-weather-dashboard
├── 2-game-day-notifications
├── 3-sports-data-lake
├── ...
└── 30-final-project
```

Each directory contains:
- **Project code**
- **README.md** detailing the day's objectives, steps, and outcomes

## Tools & Technologies
Throughout this challenge, I will be using a range of tools and technologies, including but not limited to:
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS
- **Containers**: Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
