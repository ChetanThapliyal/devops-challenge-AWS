The key concepts in these tests:

1. **Test Structure:**
   - Each test file uses Python's `unittest` framework
   - Tests are organized into classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`
   - Each test method starts with `test_`
   - `setUp` method runs before each test
   - `tearDown` method runs after each test

2. **Mock Objects:**
   - We use `unittest.mock` to create fake versions of:
     - API calls (weather API)
     - S3 storage
     - External services
   - This allows testing without actual internet connections or AWS access

3. **What We're Testing:**
   - `test_weather_api.py`:
     - Getting weather data successfully
     - Handling API errors
     - Formatting weather data correctly

   - `test_s3_utils.py`:
     - Creating S3 buckets
     - Saving weather data successfully
     - Handling S3 errors

   - `test_gui.py`:
     - Correct window setup
     - Weather data display
     - User interaction handling

4. **How to Run Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest tests/test_weather_api.py
```

5. **Testing Best Practices Used:**
   - Each test checks one specific thing
   - Tests are independent of each other
   - Clear test names that describe what's being tested
   - Proper setup and cleanup
   - Error cases are tested
   - External dependencies are mocked
