Understand the code in a simpler way, piece by piece.

1. First, let's understand the overall structure. The weather dashboard app has three main parts:
   - Getting weather data from the internet (weather_api.py)
   - Saving data to cloud storage (s3_utils.py)
   - Showing the weather information in a window (gui.py)

Let's go through each part:

2. `weather_api.py` - Getting Weather Data:
```python
class WeatherAPI:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key  # Your personal key to access weather data
        
    def get_weather_data(self, city):
        # This function gets weather info for any city
        # Like asking "What's the weather in Delhi?"
        api = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={self.api_key}"
        return requests.get(api).json()  # Gets data and converts it to Python format
        
    def format_weather_display(self, weather_data):
        # This function makes the weather data look nice
        # Converts temperature from Kelvin to Celsius
        temp = int(weather_data['main']['temp'] - 273.15)
        # Gets other info like humidity, wind speed, etc.
        # Returns two strings: main info (temperature) and detailed info
```

3. `s3_utils.py` - Saving Data to Cloud:
```python
class S3Handler:
    def __init__(self, bucket_name):
        self.bucket_name = bucket_name  # Like a folder name in the cloud
        
    def create_bucket_if_not_exists(self):
        # Creates a storage space in the cloud if it doesn't exist
        # Like creating a new folder to store files
        
    def save_weather_data(self, weather_data, city):
        # Saves the weather data to the cloud
        # Adds timestamp so you know when it was saved
        # Like saving a file with the city name and current time
```

4. `gui.py` - Creating the Window:
```python
class WeatherGUI:
    def __init__(self, weather_api, s3_handler):
        # Sets up the window where users can:
        # - Type a city name
        # - See the weather information
        
    def setup_gui(self):
        # Creates the window and adds:
        # - A text box to type city name
        # - Labels to show weather info
        
    def get_weather(self, event=None):
        # When user presses Enter:
        # 1. Gets the city name they typed
        # 2. Gets weather data for that city
        # 3. Shows the weather info
        # 4. Saves the data to cloud
```

5. `main.py` - Putting it All Together:
```python
def main():
    # 1. Loads your secret keys from a special file (.env)
    # 2. Creates all the necessary parts (weather API, storage, window)
    # 3. Starts the application
```

Here's how it all works together:
1. You run `main.py`
2. A window opens
3. You type a city name and press Enter
4. The app:
   - Gets weather data for that city from the internet
   - Shows it nicely in the window
   - Saves a copy of the data to cloud storage

Think of it like this:
- `weather_api.py` is like a weather person who checks the weather
- `s3_utils.py` is like a filing clerk who keeps records
- `gui.py` is like a TV screen that shows you the information
- `main.py` is like a manager who makes sure everyone works together

Each file has a specific job, which makes the code:
- Easier to understand
- Easier to fix if something breaks
- Easier to add new features
